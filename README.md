# Introduction
The first time try to create an open source project. I don't know where I should start? how to start with a correct way? >.<

I NEVER KNOW IF I DON'T DO IT.

So try with the idea create React component based on TailwindCSS and share it with everyone.

I hope that it'll helpful to you.

# Technical things I want to go with
- Typescript
- React class component
- TailwindCSS
